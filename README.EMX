This copy of the GNU readline library has been compiled with emx+gcc
using the emx 0.9c development tools. It can be used under
OS/2, DOS and Win32.

An up to date copy should always be available as

  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/devtools/gnureadl.zip

It requires the emx 0.9c or newer runtime under OS/2 and RSXNT 1.40
under Win32. Both can be found at

  ftp://ftp.leo.org/pub/comp/os/os2/leo/gnu/emx+gcc/...

The binos2 subdirectory contains an OS/2 DLL and import library as
well as a generic a.out object library for OS/2, DOS and Win32
emx executables. The binnt subdirectory contains a Win32 DLL
and import library. Applications linked to the OS/2 or Win32 DLL 
libraries always have to be linked with -Zcrtdll (OS/2) or
compiled and linked with -Zcrtdll=crtrsxnt (Win32).
